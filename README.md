# moodle-question_bank_bulkedit
This is a proof of concept example of what a Moodle 4.0 Question bank plugins can be like.
It allows multiple questions to be selected and a chance to update the text within all selected questions.
It is purely to illustrate the concept of question bank plugins for the purpose of information and inspiration, it
may not do what it claims to do and it might do things you don't expect it to.

Do not install on a live site or put anywhere near data that matters to you.
